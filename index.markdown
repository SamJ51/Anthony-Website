Hi, I’m Anthony Kachenko, an accomplished agribusiness professional with a deep passion for advancing sustainability, resilience, and growth in primary industries and natural resource management. With extensive experience across technical, strategic, and operational domains, I’m committed to fostering innovation, driving capacity building, and delivering meaningful environmental and societal outcomes.

I’m a strong advocate for collaboration and stakeholder engagement, excelling in building trusted relationships with industry, government, and community partners to co-create solutions that balance economic, environmental, and social priorities. My leadership style is ‘can-do’ and solution-focussed, and I thrive on bringing fresh perspectives to long-standing challenges.
