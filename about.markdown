# About Me

## My Background

I’m Anthony Kachenko, a seasoned agribusiness professional with a career spanning technical, strategic, and operational roles in primary industries and natural resource management. I’ve had the privilege of working with some of Australia’s leading organisations, including Nursery and Garden Industry Australia (NGIA) as the National Environmental & Technical Policy Manager, and currently as the General Manager of Production & Sustainability R&D at [Hort Innovation](https://www.horticulture.com.au/). My work has always been driven by a deep passion for sustainability and innovation, aiming to create resilient systems that benefit both the environment and Aussie communities.

I’ve been fortunate to contribute to industry-wide initiatives, such as speaking at the 2022 Future of Food Summit in Brisbane, where I joined a panel on innovative solutions for indoor cropping. I’ve also engaged with media, like my chat on ABC Northern Tasmania’s *Country Hour* in June 2024, where I discussed fun ways to boost veggie consumption among Aussies—like chocolate-covered Brussels sprouts!

## My Interests

Outside of work, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of environment, industry, and community well-being. I’m inspired by Indigenous knowledge and sustainable practices, such as those shared by chef Mindy Woods at the Future of Food Summit, where she highlighted the diversity of native Australian tucker and its cultural significance. I’m also a bit of a nature enthusiast—I love spending time in Australia’s urban forests and rainforests, which fuel my commitment to protecting and enhancing these spaces.

I believe collaboration is key to innovation, and I enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and tackle challenges. Whether it’s through professional summits or a yarn over a coffee, I’m always keen to explore new perspectives.

## Why I Do What I Do

My mission is to drive impactful change at the intersection of environment, industry, and innovation. I’m motivated by the potential to create healthier, happier communities through sustainable practices—whether that’s by valuing urban trees, increasing Aussie veggie consumption, or integrating traditional knowledge into modern food systems. I approach every challenge with a ‘can-do’ mindset, aiming to deliver solutions that make a real difference.
