## Key Projects and Achievements

### Advancing Urban Forestry with NGIA

While at [Nursery and Garden Industry Australia (NGIA)](https://greenlifeindustry.com.au/), I led initiatives to promote a thriving, sustainable, and diverse Australian urban forest. My team and I developed tools to help local councils and communities recognise the value of urban trees as essential environmental, economic, and community assets.

- **i-Tree Eco (Australian Adaptation)**: I spearheaded the Australian version of [i-Tree Eco (version 5)](http://www.itreetools.org/eco/international.php), a tool that quantifies the monetary value of trees based on their contributions to carbon storage, sequestration, and air pollution reduction. This project aimed to secure increased funding for urban planting infrastructure, fostering healthier communities across Australia.
- **New Tree Standards**: I contributed to drafting new tree standards for Standards Australia, focusing on best practices for tree suppliers. These standards cover attributes like formative pruning, stem taper, crown symmetry, root direction, and rootball occupancy, aiming to replace or supplement NATSPEC with clear checklists for growers and buyers.

### Innovating Horticulture at Hort Innovation

As the General Manager of Production & Sustainability R&D at [Hort Innovation](https://www.horticulture.com.au/), I’ve been working to boost innovation and consumption in the horticulture sector, addressing challenges like climate change and food security.

- **Future of Food Summit 2022**: I participated in the inaugural Future of Food Summit in Brisbane, joining a panel on ‘Working Smarter, Not Harder: Innovative Solutions for Indoor Cropping’. We explored sustainable approaches like protected cropping to strengthen food production systems, emphasizing the role of collaboration in driving innovation amidst the ‘three Cs’—COVID-19, climate, and conflict.
- **Boosting Veggie Consumption**: I’ve championed initiatives to increase Aussie vegetable consumption, as 9 in 10 Australians don’t eat enough veggies. One fun idea I discussed on ABC Northern Tasmania’s *Country Hour* in June 2024 was chocolate-covered Brussels sprouts—a healthy snacking option to engage younger generations. This project also opens export opportunities, taking Australian innovation global.

## Industry Engagement

- **Media Appearances**: I’ve shared my insights on platforms like ABC Northern Tasmania’s *Country Hour*, discussing innovative horticulture products and their potential to lift consumption and support export markets.
- **Summit Contributions**: At the 2022 Future of Food Summit, I engaged with industry leaders, government, and academia to tackle pressing challenges in global food supply, advocating for smart, sustainable, and resilient food systems.

My work continues to focus on creating impactful solutions that balance economic, environmental, and social priorities. I’m always keen to collaborate on new projects—visit my [Contact page](/contact/) to get in touch!
